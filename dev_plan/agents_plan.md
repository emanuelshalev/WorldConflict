# 🎯 Goal

Implement the MVP defined in `SPEC.md` by completing all **P0 tasks** in `TASKS.md`, then P1 tasks if time permits.

**Deliverable:** A fully functional, deterministic 25-country global conflict simulator.

---

# 🚀 Operating Mode

End-to-end autonomous execution with minimal human intervention:

```
1️⃣ Read SPEC.md      → Understand complete scope
2️⃣ Read TASKS.md     → Execute P0 tasks top-to-bottom  
3️⃣ Implement         → test → fix → commit → repeat
4️⃣ STOP only when    → All P0 complete OR hard technical blocker
```

---

# ⚠️ Critical Constraints

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 📖 **SPEC.md is truth** | Never expand scope beyond MVP definition |
| 📋 **TASKS.md priority** | Complete P0 before touching P1 |
| ✅ **Always working** | Keep `npm run dev` working after every change |
| 🌍 **25 countries max** | No Tier 2/3 countries until Phase 2 |
| 🔒 **Pure core** | `/core` has ZERO LLM/network dependencies |
| 📝 **Structured output** | Validate ALL agent responses with Zod |
| 💾 **Incremental commits** | One logical task per commit |

---

# ✅ Definition of Done (MVP)

Project ships when **ALL** are true:

| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| All P0 tasks completed (TASKS.md) | ⬜ |
| `npm run dev` runs without errors | ⬜ |
| Player completes 24-turn game (no crashes) | ⬜ |
| Simulation 100% deterministic (same seed = same results) | ⬜ |
| Turn resolution <200ms (25 countries) | ⬜ |
| Save/load verified across 10 games | ⬜ |
| AI generates valid intents 98%+ of turns | ⬜ |
| Map renders smoothly (60fps) | ⬜ |
| Leadership report generates correctly | ⬜ |
| All core systems >95% unit test coverage | ⬜ |
| Offline mode functional (no LLM required) | ⬜ |
| README.md has setup + quickstart | ⬜ |

---

# 🔄 Verification Loop

**Run after EVERY task:**

```bash
# 1. Lint
npm run lint          # → Fix all errors

# 2. Test  
npm run test          # → 100% pass rate

# 3. Build
npm run build         # → Clean build

# 4. Smoke Test
npm run dev           # → Manual test:
                      #   New game → 3 turns → save → reload → end

# 5. Performance
npm run perf          # → <200ms turns

# ❌ If ANY fail → diagnose → fix → repeat
```

---

# 💾 Commit Protocol

After each completed task:

### 1️⃣ Update TASKS.md
```markdown
- [x] Task description  ← Mark complete
```
Move to `## COMPLETED` section

### 2️⃣ Append to PROGRESS.md
```
2026-03-07 | Task 1.2 | feat: world state types (1.2)
Files: src/core/world.ts, src/core/types.ts
Tests: 12/12 passed | Build: ✅ | Perf: 45ms
Notes: Added Zod validation for WorldState
```

### 3️⃣ Git Commit
```
<type>: <description> (<task-id>)

Examples:
feat: implement country state model (2.1)
test: add world validation tests (2.2)
fix: resolve turn resolution perf issue (3.4)
docs: update readme with setup (9.1)
```

# 🔧 Tech Stack

> **LOCKED — NO deviations**

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| **Language** | TypeScript (strict) |
| **Backend** | Node.js 20+ / Fastify |
| **Frontend** | React 18 / Vite / Zustand |
| **Maps** | MapLibre GL JS + OpenStreetMap |
| **UI** | Mantine 7.x |
| **Database** | SQLite / Prisma |
| **Validation** | Zod schemas |
| **Testing** | Vitest + Playwright |
| **Build** | Vite (frontend/backend) |

---

# 🤖 Agent Instructions

## LLM Integration Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Validation | ALWAYS validate JSON outputs with Zod |
| Token limits | <8k input, <1k output per request |
| Parallelism | Parallel calls for all 25 countries |
| Fallback | `heuristicAI()` if LLM fails 3x |
| Immutability | NEVER mutate WorldState directly |

## Prompt Templates

| Agent | Prompt Start |
|-------|--------------|
| **CountryAgent** | "You are [COUNTRY] leader. Given YOUR belief state..." |
| **AdvisorAgent** | "You are [ROLE] advisor. Player asks..." |
| **NarrativeAgent** | "Write neutral newspaper headline for..." |

## Performance Guardrails

- Turn resolution **MUST** be <200ms (25 countries)
- Profile with `npm run perf` after each system
- If >150ms → **Optimize before next feature**

---

# 🛑 Handling Blockers

## Minor Ambiguity → Continue

1. Make smallest reasonable assumption
2. Document in PROGRESS.md: `"Assumed X per SPEC.md Y"`
3. Add TODO comment in code
4. Proceed

## Hard Blocker → STOP

| Blocker | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Cannot run `npm run dev` | STOP |
| Tests consistently fail (>10% red) | STOP |
| SPEC.md contradiction found | STOP |
| LLM returns invalid JSON >5 attempts | STOP |

**Output final status + blocker details to PROGRESS.md**
